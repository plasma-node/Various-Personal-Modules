# RandomPublicModules

Here are some random modules I have made or modified (some will have external dependencies which are included)

## Disclaimer
This repo contains modules and utilities that I have made or modified for my own use. **These modules may or may not be useful** to you. Some modules may have messy code as I do not enforce any sort of styling standards outside of my own personal style. Some code may need minor modifications (ie changing dependencies) to work, and I should also note that some modules might have redundant dependency libraries. 


This code was formatted for [Argon](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/argon-vs-code-sync-plugin/2021776). What this means is that a module named "FooModule" with children must be formatted as a folder named `FooModule` with a `.source.lua` file as the code for the module. 

Some modules will be documented, others will not. Any high quality utilities or projects I make will be stored in a separate repository.
