# RandomPublicModules

Here are some random modules I have made or modified (some will have external dependencies which are included)

## DISCLAIMER

This is a casual repository of some modules that I have either made or modified for my own use, that I have decided to make public. 
**These modules may or may not be useful to you**.

I do not enforce any styling guide other than what I use for my own personal style.   

Some code may require minor modification (ie fixing require paths) to work.    

This code was formatted for [Argon](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/argon-vs-code-sync-plugin/2021776).     
What this means is that a module named "FooModule" with children must be formatted as a folder named `FooModule` with a `.source.lua` file as the code for the module. 

Some modules will be documented, others will not. Any high quality utilities or projects I make will be stored in a separate repository.
